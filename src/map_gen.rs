/* I figured that we could use our tests as make shift background
 * monitor until we get a UI running in bevy
 *
 * Use the make file to run the tests, otherwise the print macros won't work
 * If you can't use the Makefile for some reason, you can also run cargo
 * like so:
 *
 *     cargo test -- --nocapture
